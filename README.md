# mock-aiohttp

Attempting to create a reusable mock for testing with `aiohttp.ClientSession()`.

> ⚠️ This project is still under development. Expect breaking changes.

## Notes

MVP:

- [ ] Make reusable pytest plugin / fixture / mock / thing for mocking aiohttp.ClientSession
- [ ] Figure out github to pypi release strategy
- [ ] Test it. Repeatidly.

## Installation

```sh
pip install mock-aiohttp
```

Currently, this won't do anything. I'm still learning how to make pytest fixtures.

## Development

Git clone this repo, then use `poetry install`
